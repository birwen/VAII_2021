  <h1>Houses</h1>
  <h3>First House</h3>
  <p><span>The House Of Self</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>
      Defined by the Ascendant, the First House defines you. It represents the body you were born with, your physical appearance, and your general temperament.
      Natal planets that occupy the First House tend to have a very strong influence in that person's life (for instance, Mercury in the First House is a sign of a chatterbox,
      while the moon in the First House reveals someone who wears emotions on their sleeve). Since this is the first stop in the cycle, when planets in the sky transit into this house,
      our goals are manifested, and new projects, ideas, or perspectives finally take form. This House corresponds with Aries energy.
    </span>
  </p>
  <h3>Second House</h3>
  <p><span>The House Of Finances & Value</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>
      The Second House is related to our personal finances, material possessions, and the concept of value. While it does rule money, it also covers our emotions,
      which live inside of us (and often affect us even more than money does). Natal planets in the Second House tend to seek security through their material world.
      Planets transiting the Second House reveal changes in resources or self-esteem. This House corresponds with Taurus energy.

  </p>
  <h3>Third House</h3>
  <p><span>The House Of Communication</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>
      Communication, transportation, and local community are all governed by the third house. Natal planets in the Third House are motivated by expression
      and often help guide you to build close relationships with their peers, [including siblings, coworkers, and classmates. Communication is the solution to most problems,
      and the basis of all successful relationships, so make sure to honor and nurture this sector of your chart. When planets transit the Third House, we often receive
      important information about our immediate network. This House corresponds with Gemini energy.
    </span>
  </p>
  <h3>Fourth House</h3>
  <p><span>The House Of Home</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>
      The Fourth House sits at the base of the chart and symbolizes home and family. Natal planets in the Fourth House reveal an individual's relationship with the maternal figure,
      as well as their unique outlook on domesticity. Planets moving across the Fourth House often encourage us to invest in our infrastructure by creating more private,
      nurturing spaces that make us feel safe, loved, and cared for. The Fourth House also rules your relationships with people (and pets) who are family, either blood or chosen.
      This House corresponds with Cancer energy.
    </span>
  </p>
  <h3>Fifth House</h3>
  <p><span>The House Of Pleasure & Creativity</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>
      This playful zone of the Fifth house is linked to creativity, romance, and children. Natal planets in the Fifth House are linked to your intrinsic artistic expression,
      while planets transiting the Fifth House often deliver eureka moments that boost our confidence. The Fifth House is all about what makes you feel good,
      whether it's orgasms, attention, or the fulfilling work of a creative project. This House corresponds with Leo energy.
    </span>
  </p>
  <h3>Sixth House</h3>
  <p><span>The House Of Health & Service</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>
      The Sixth House corresponds with health, wellness, and daily routines, including odd jobs. Where the body you're born with exists in the First House,
      the choices made over a lifetime create the body found in your Sixth House. Naturally, our environment and life choices affect our health, such as self-care,
      having a good work-life balance, and whether you spend enough (or too much!) time in the sun, so let this house remind you to pay attention to your physical and mental well-being.
      Those with natal planets in this zone are often fueled by organization and structure and tend to focus on time and calendar management.
      Planets transiting the Sixth House help us form habits and redefine our schedules. This House corresponds with Virgo energy.

  </p>
  <h3>Seventh House</h3>
  <p><span>The House Of Partnerships</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>
      The Seventh House (the Descendent) sits directly across from the First House Ascendant and represents life-changing partnerships.
      Up until now, all the Houses have explored an individual's immediate world: their money, home, and friends. In the Seventh House,
      however, the concept of perspective is introduced. Simply put, the Seventh House symbolizes your "cosmic plus one," and yes,
      that refers to romantic partners, as well as other important relationships in your life. Those with natal planets in the Seventh House tend to be very focused on relationships,
      gravitating towards partnership in all areas of life. Planets moving through the Seventh House help us close deals, securing our bonds by signing contracts, and making things official.
      This House corresponds with Libra energy.
    </span>
  </p>
  <h3>Eighth House</h3>
  <p><span>The House Of Sex & Transformation</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>
      What do sex, death, and transformation have to do with one another? Well, they're all animalistic instincts.
      Those with natal planets in the Eighth House are often attracted to supernatural or occult topics, have intense romances,
      and will likely go through several fabulous makeovers within their lifetime. The Eighth House reminds us that it's okay to give in to our desires,
      we're going to die one day after all, but to always be adaptable and ready to let go of the past to make room for the present and future.
      Planets transiting this area help us understand the underbelly of any situation and serve as a reminder of lifeâ€™s complexities. This House corresponds with Scorpio energy.

  </p>
  <h3>Ninth House</h3>
  <p><span>The House Of Big Ideas</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>
      Travel, philosophy, and higher education all define the ninth house. In medieval astrology, this region was linked to places and people outside of your village.
      Now, we interpret this area as both literal and intellectual exploration. Those born with natal planets in the Ninth House are extremely curious and inquisitive,
      with deep-rooted wanderlust. When planets move across the Ninth House we often begin studying a new topic, move to a foreign location, or adopt a completely different perspective.
      The Ninth House encourages you to keep an open mind and be willing to learn new things as your world changes and expands. This House corresponds with Sagittarius energy.
    </span>
  </p>
  <h3>Tenth House</h3>
  <p><span>The House Of Public Image</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>
      The Tenth House, located at the very top of the birth chart, is the apex of your unique story, and yes, is basically the House of popularity.
      The Tenth House also governs public image, professional aspirations, and career achievements. Natal planets in the Tenth House reveal an ambitious individual,
      and changes in the profession often occur when planets transit this zone. This House corresponds with Capricorn energy.
    </span>
  </p>
  <h3>Eleventh House</h3>
  <p><span>The House Of Community & Friends</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>
      As the houses begin their descent, the Eleventh House helps us remember the purpose of our hard work, and with who we share the joy of our accomplishments.
      The Eleventh House is linked to humanitarian pursuits, as well as our personal network. This covers our dear friends and support system who help keep us moving forward.
      Technology and innovation also exist within this zone, so those born with planets in the Eleventh House are often defined by their revolutionary ideas.
      Transiting planets through this domain help us broaden our reach as we define our role within society. This House corresponds with Aquarius energy.
    </span>
  </p>
  <h3>Twelfth House</h3>
  <p><span>The House Of Subconscious & Secrets</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>
      In the sky, the Twelfth House exists just beneath the horizon: It's quite literally the darkness before dawn. Likewise, the Twelfth House is considered the "unseen realm,"
      and governs all things that exist without physical forms, like dreams, secrets, and emotions. Those born with planets in the Twelfth House are often highly intuitive,
      perhaps even psychic. We attract karmic people into our lives when planets transit the Twelfth House, but during this time,
      we must also remember that not all relationships are meant to last. This House corresponds with Pisces energy.
